## Star-chasing merchant
A text-based game inspired by Space Station 13/14, Godville and some other ideas.

## Status
I am developing this project alone to study programming in JS/TS, working with databases, testing and using CI/CD tools. This means that the project may never be completed, but I hope to bring it to a minimum working condition with the skeletons of the basic mechanics.

I have no plans to develop a complete frontend for this project, except for the one that will be necessary for full-cover testing. This may change in the future.
